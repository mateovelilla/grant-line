    "description": "\"Desert King\" Sir Crocodile[3][13] is a former Warlord of the Sea[7] and the former president of the mysterious crime syndicate Baroque Works,[14] formerly operating under the codename \"Mr. 0\". During his time as Warlord, Crocodile maintained a public facade of an ally to both the people of Arabasta Kingdom and the Marines, all while running Baroque Works in secret with the express purpose of overthrowing Arabasta via Operation Utopia. When his plot was foiled by the Straw Hat Pirates, [4] he was stripped of his title and imprisoned in the deepest level of the legendary prison Impel Down.[15] His former partner and Vice-President of Baroque Works, Nico Robin, would go on to become a member of the Straw Hat Pirates.\n",
    "appareance": "Crocodile was freed by Luffy from Impel Down in exchange for aiding in the rescue of his brother[16] and went to Marineford to participate in the Summit War.[17] While initially aiming to kill Whitebeard, his contempt for the Marines led him to ally with Luffy and the Whitebeard Pirates. After the war, he and his subordinate Daz Bonez escaped from Marineford and decided to head out to the New World.[18] After the disbandment of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Crocodile now works as a co-leader of the Cross Guild alongside Dracule Mihawk and under the figurehead leadership of Buggy, who was mistakenly made one of the Four Emperors.[19] Sometime prior to the disbanding of the Warlords, Vegapunk cloned Crocodile as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords.[20]\n"

To that end he stole the shadows of several beings with his Kage Kage no Mi powers, including Brook and several members of the Straw Hat Pirates, bringing him into conflict with them. His zombie army was ultimately destroyed and the captured shadows set free after his defeat but he retained his position as a Warlord and escaped Thriller Bark with the remnants of his crew. He took part in the Summit War of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords.[10] After the end of the war, he was stripped of his title and was to be eliminated by Donquixote Doflamingo,[3] but he managed to escape into the New World.[11] Vegapunk later cloned Moria as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords.[12] Two years after the war, he attacked the Blackbeard Pirates on Hachinosu,[13] but was defeated and imprisoned when he refused to join Blackbeard.[14] He was later rescued by Perona with the help of Koby.[15]\n"

On his chest he has a green cuirass, whose front and back portions are connected by metal straps that go over both his collarbones. The cuirass' color was later changed to a rusty red color. Around his waist there is a big, elaborated golden belt, worn over what looks like a green skirt similar to the ones worn by Aztecs, with golden decorations near the edge. He also wears what look like studded, black and gold large-buckled shoes or boots and matching black studded pants. During the Summit War of Marineford, he lost his right arm when Aokiji froze him and the arm broke off.[9]\n"
